# MSGARCH_comp
Comparison of Value-at-Risk forecasting performance of Markov-Switching GARCH models, namely symmetric GARCH, EGARCH, GJR-GARCH, 
based on stock markets universe. 

The data considered here are 5,000 daily percentage log returns of DAX, S&P500, and Nikkei.
3,000 daily log reutrns are fit to 2-state-Markov-switching GARCH-type models as mentioned above, each with 2 innovation assumptions: Normal and Student's t distributions.

Model estimation is done by MCMC, using a robust adaptive random-walk Metropolis algorithm proposed by Vihola (2012).
The forecasting horizons used here are 1, 3, 10 and 22, and the VaR is calculated at 1% shortfall probability.

For a fixed rolling-window length of 3,000, the experiment is repeated 2,000 times, providing the 2,000 out-of-sample data, which later on used for evaluating the forecasting performance of each model setting.

The goodness of in-sample fit is evaulated based on:  
(1) The Akaike information criterion (AIC) and  
(2) The Bayesian information criterion (BIC).

The forecasting performance is evaluated based on  
(1) Backtesting:  
     + Unconditional coverage test by Kupiec (1995)  
     + Independence test by Christoffersen (1998)  
     + Conditional coverage test by Christoffersen (1998)  
     + Dynamic quantile test of Engle and Mangenelli (2004)  
(2) Model confidence set by Hansen et al. (2011), with the VaR-based loss function defined by Gonz√°lez-Rivera et al (2004).
